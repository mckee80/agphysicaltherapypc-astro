## 1b. Category Recommendations

**Primary Category (pick one — this drives the most visibility):**
- **Physical Therapist** — best fit, highest search volume

**Recommended Additional Categories (2-4 relevant ones perform better than stuffing):**
- [ ] Physical Therapy Clinic
- [ ] Pelvic Floor Therapist *(check availability — Google has been adding this)*
- [ ] Women's Health Clinic
- [ ] Health Consultant

**Consider but verify availability:**
- Orthopedic Clinic *(only if ortho is a significant part of the business)*
- Rehabilitation Center *(broad, but can help with discovery)*

**Avoid these categories:**
- Massage Therapist — wrong signals, different clientele
- Chiropractor, Acupuncturist — unrelated specialties
- Hospital / Medical Center — too broad, wrong expectations

> **Note:** The primary category drives the most visibility. Additional categories help but have diminishing returns. Reviews, photos, and keeping GBP services aligned with the website matter more than extra categories.
