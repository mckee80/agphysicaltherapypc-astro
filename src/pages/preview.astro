          <h2 class="section-title">Why I Started Doing Pelvic Floor Therapy in San Diego</h2>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            After my first baby was born in 2015, I couldn't run, jump, or even sneeze without leaking. My OB told me to "just do kegels." That advice didn't work. I'm a Doctor of Physical Therapy, and even I had trouble finding someone locally who could actually help me.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            That experience changed everything for me. I saw how many women in San Diego — in Vista, Carlsbad, Oceanside, Rancho Bernardo — were going through the same thing and being told it was just "normal after kids." It's common, but it's not something you have to live with.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            Now I bring pelvic floor therapy directly to women across North County San Diego. I come to your home, I see you at my clinic in Rancho Bernardo, or we meet over video. Every session is one-on-one, 60 to 90 minutes, just you and me. No rushing, no rotating between patients.
          </p>
          <div class="philosophy-box">
            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <p>I look at your whole body, not just your pelvic floor. Strengthening the pelvic floor is <strong>not "just do kegels."</strong> Everything needs to work together — your core, your hips, your breathing, your pelvic floor. That's how real healing happens.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy</h2>
        <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-4">
          A lot of women in San Diego don't even know pelvic floor physical therapy exists. They think leaking, pain, or pressure down there is just something they have to accept. It's not.
        </p>
        <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-4">
          Pelvic floor therapy works on the muscles that support your bladder, uterus, and bowel. Sometimes those muscles are too weak. Sometimes they're too tight. Sometimes it's both. I do a full assessment — internal and external — to figure out exactly what's going on with you. Then we build a plan around your body and your goals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-brand-navy-light">
          Whether you're dealing with leaking, pelvic pressure, pain during sex, or you just feel like something isn't right — pelvic floor therapy can help. I treat patients from Vista, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Oceanside, Escondido, San Marcos, and throughout the Rancho Bernardo area.

            Your body just did something amazing. But "bouncing back" isn't as simple as social media makes it look. After giving birth, so many women in San Diego struggle with getting back to normal activities — picking up their baby, going for a walk, returning to the gym.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light">
            As a Postpartum Corrective Exercise Specialist, I help new moms heal safely. We work on your core, your pelvic floor, C-section scar recovery, and getting you back to the activities you love. I also come to your home — because getting out the door with a newborn is hard enough.

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-4">
            Leaking when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or run is common — but it's not something you should just live with. This was my own experience after having kids. I couldn't even chase my toddler down the street without leaking.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light">
            Urinary incontinence treatment through pelvic floor therapy works. We figure out why you're leaking — weak muscles, tight muscles, coordination issues, or all of the above — and fix it. Most women see real changes within a few weeks.

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-4">
            That gap down the middle of your belly after pregnancy? That's diastasis recti. It's the separation of your ab muscles, and it affects how your whole core works — your back, your pelvic floor, everything.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light">
            Diastasis recti rehabilitation is about more than closing the gap. It's about getting your core to function again as a team. I give you a personalized exercise program that works with your body, not against it. No crunches. No generic PDFs. A real plan built for you.

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-4">
            Pelvic pain can show up in a lot of ways — pain during sex, tailbone pain, hip pain that won't go away, pain near a C-section scar months or years later. A lot of women go from doctor to doctor without getting answers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-navy-light">
            Pelvic pain treatment starts with actually listening to your story and doing a thorough exam. I look at your pelvic floor muscles, your hips, your core, your posture — the whole picture. One of my patients came to me a year after her C-section with unexplained pain near her scar. Her doctors couldn't figure it out. We did, and she got better.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Do I need a referral for pelvic floor therapy in San Diego?</summary>
          <p>No. In California, you don't need a doctor's referral for physical therapy. If your insurance requires a referral, check with your provider first.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What happens at the first pelvic floor therapy appointment?</summary>
          <p>Your first visit is 90 minutes. We talk about your history, your symptoms, and your goals. Then I do a full assessment — which can include an internal and external exam of your pelvic floor muscles, but only with your consent and at your comfort level. You leave with a personalized exercise plan and a clear picture of what's going on.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How soon will I see results from pelvic floor therapy?</summary>
          <p>Most women start noticing changes within a few weeks. Some feel better after the first session. It depends on what we're treating, but I'll give you honest expectations from the start.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Do you take insurance?</summary>
          <p>I'm an out-of-network provider. That means insurance doesn't dictate your care. You get longer sessions, one-on-one attention, and a treatment plan built around you — not around billing codes. I can provide superbills for you to submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>When should I start postpartum physical therapy?</summary>
          <p>You can start as early as 6 weeks postpartum, or later — there's no expiration date. I see women who are 3 months, 1 year, or 10 years postpartum. If something doesn't feel right, it's worth getting checked out.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can you help with pain during sex?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Pain during sex is one of the most common reasons women seek pelvic floor therapy. It's often caused by tight pelvic floor muscles, scar tissue, or hormonal changes. It's treatable, and you don't have to just live with it.</p>
