          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-heading font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-6">My Story</h2>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            I graduated from Western University of Health Sciences with a Doctorate in Physical Therapy in 2011.
          </p>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            I began my career in outpatient Orthopedics, where I worked with a huge variety of patients. After I had my first child in 2015, I had the most difficult time accepting my new body. My biggest issue was urinary incontinence. I couldn't make any hard impact movements — running, jumping, squatting, sneezing, coughing — without leaking heavily! My OB-GYN told me to "just do kegels" and it was "normal" after childbirth. So, I continued on with life with no improvements with a side of postpartum depression. I couldn't even chase my 15-month-old when he darted out into the street.
          </p>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            I had my second child in 2017 and was worse than where I had started. At this time, pelvic health Physical Therapy was becoming more recognized, but I still didn't know how to locate anyone locally that could examine me and help me start to rehabilitate. I had taken my first pelvic health course back in 2013. This was before children, so I didn't realize the importance and the struggles that women go through after childbirth.
          </p>

          <div class="philosophy-box mb-8">
            <h3>My Mission</h3>
            <p>The lack of resources for women postpartum and entering perimenopause fueled my desire to advocate and provide <strong>hope, compassion, and accessible care</strong>.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-8">
            I continued my pelvic health specialty and dove head first into courses, podcasts, journal articles, and books to provide the best evidence-based care to my clients.
          </p>

          <!-- Why We're Different -->
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-heading font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-6">Why Are We Different?</h2>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-6">
            We combine Women's Health and Orthopedics, and look at the body as a whole. We are Postpartum Corrective Exercise Specialists, and can offer a very personalized home exercise program to facilitate your healing process. Internal and external pelvic floor work can be performed in order to address each patient's individual needs. So, you are getting the best of both worlds. Everything needs to be working in harmony.
          </p>

          <p class="text-brand-navy-light mb-8">
            Being an out-of-network provider also allows my services not to be dictated by insurance. Which means longer treatment sessions, one-on-one care with a Doctor of Physical Therapy, and better quality of care.
          </p>
