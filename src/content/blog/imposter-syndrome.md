What is imposter syndrome? An internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be, as if you are a fraud. The experience of feeling like a phony in some area of your life, despite any success that you have achieved in that area.

I have heard this term A LOT recently. With all the social media and entrepreneurs, it is a problem. Excessively comparing yourself and your business to others that perform it better or can present themselves as better, more knowledgeable, or powerful.

I have definitely experienced this, trying to branch off on my own and become an independent practitioner. So many hurdles get in the way, but a lot of it is in your own mind. You become your own enemy.

My husband turned me to an excellent podcast, "The Jim Fortin" podcast, and he teaches you about spiraling and compiling. Basically, using your mind power to stop yourself from going down into a dark space by simply moving your attention. I know it sounds easy enough, but you can't imagine how hard it is to physically and mentally stop your brain from going down that spiral, and then never doing what you set out to do. I highly recommend listening if you struggle from this.

I still struggle, but I have improved, and I will not stop until I do what I said I was going to do.
