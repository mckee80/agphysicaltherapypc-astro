Leaking urine when you cough, sneeze, run, or jump? This is called stress urinary incontinence. There are several factors that contribute to this condition, such as: childbirth, weakness of the core and pelvic floor, inability to manage intra-abdominal pressure, pelvic organ prolapse, chronic cough, and more.
